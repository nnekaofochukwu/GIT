Introduction:

In this hands-on practical assignment, you will dive deep into the world of version control systems, specifically focusing on Git, 

its basic and advanced commands, branching and merging strategies. 

You will understand the importance of version control in collaborative software development and explore Git's wide adoption in the industry. 

Throughout the assignment, you will be required to take screenshots of your progress and push them to GitHub for review.

Objective:

The primary objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Git and its fundamental concepts while practicing collaborative development workflows using Git. 

By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in using Git for version control and contributing to projects in a team environment.

Assignment Tasks:

Task 1: Understanding Version Control Systems (VCS)

Research and write a brief summary discussing the importance of version control in collaborative software development.

Explore different version control systems other than Git and provide a comparison highlighting why Git is widely adopted. (Use a Text file to  explain in your own words)

Task 2: Getting Started with Git

Install Git on your local machine if you haven't already.

Create a new Git repository locally.

Perform basic Git commands such as initializing a repository, staging files, committing changes, and viewing commit history.

Take screenshots at each step and push them to GitHub.


Task 3: Branching and Merging Strategies

Research and understand different branching models such as Git Flow.

Implement a branching strategy of your choice for a sample project (e.g., feature branching, Git Flow).

Practice merging branches and resolving merge conflicts.

Take screenshots of branching, merging, and conflict resolution processes and push them to  github


Task 5: Collaborative Development using Git

Fork an open-source project on GitHub.

Clone the forked repository to your local machine. ( https://github.com/josephifekwe97/Prestmit_ui_test.git)

Make a contribution to the project (e.g., create a file with  your name).

Create a pull request and engage in a code review process.

Added a fellow classmate as a  collaborator or Reviewer

Take screenshots of forking, cloning, contribution, pull request creation, and code review process, and push them to GitHub.

Task 6: Git Best Practices  (Optional)

Research and compile a list of Git best practices for large teams and distributed development.

Discuss the importance of following these best practices in a team environment.

Implement at least three of these best practices in your own Git workflow.
